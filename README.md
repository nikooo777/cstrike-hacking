# CS:S Cheats (Nikooo777's H4X)

## Introduction

I love playing games, mostly those built on top of source engine. I also love programming, and while C++ is definitely NOT my language of choice
I still enjoy messing with it.

This repository holds my experiments with game hacking where for the sole purpose of learning I try to implement my own
Counter-Strike: Source cheats.

If you came here thinking to download an executable and have fun cheating, you're in the wrong place. I have 0 knowledge on how to bypass anticheats such as VAC.

## IDE

Since everyone uses Visual Studio, I'll go ahead and use Clion by JetBrains. I do most if not all of my development using their tools, and I like the portability over Linux.

## Do you want to learn how to make your own cheats?

["EzPz."](https://guidedhacking.com/threads/ghb1-start-here-beginner-guide-to-game-hacking.5911/) <- that's what I'm doing

## Why CS:S?
I chose CS:S for no particular reason other than the fact that it's an old game (still played!) where I have 8000+ hours of playtime on it (some of it idle uh...)
that's very similar to CS:GO and has a lot of documentation out there.

Additionally, the game does not receive frequent updates anymore which makes it a little bit easier to take things slowly without going crazy with offset/signature updates.
