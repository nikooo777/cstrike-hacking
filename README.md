# CS:S Cheats (Nikooo777's H4X)

## Introduction

I love playing games, mostly those built on top of source engine. I also love programming, and while C++ is definitely NOT my language of choice
I still enjoy messing with it.

This repository holds my experiments with game hacking where for the sole purpose of learning I try to implement my own
Counter-Strike: Source cheats.

If you came here thinking to download an executable and have fun cheating, you're in the wrong place. I have 0 knowledge on how to bypass anticheats such as VAC.

## IDE

Since everyone uses Visual Studio, I'll go ahead and use Clion by JetBrains. I do most if not all of my development using their tools, and I like the portability over Linux.
